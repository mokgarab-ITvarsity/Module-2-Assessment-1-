                   <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                   <p>Elephants are fascinating creatures. Being the largest of all land mammals on Earth, many aspects of their huge anatomy are a source of amazement themselves, whilst their high level of social development makes them an intriguing subject for observation. Furthermore, we are increasingly learning that they play a vital role in the natural environment, and in maintaining the balance of fragile ecosystems. Unfortunately however, decades of negative interactions with humans have reduced the numbers of these gentle giants significantly. Read on to learn more about these incredible creatures, and what you can do to help protect and conserve their populations.</p>
                   <p>Before we begin however, it may be important to clear up the all important question of how many species of elephant are there? Quite simply, there are two distinct species: the African elephant and the Asian elephant. Over many years however, there have been debates about how many types of elephants are there – and the general consensus is that there are two further subspecies of the African elephant. These are forest elephants and savannah elephants.</p>
                   <p>An elephant’s trunk is a very impressive multi-tool. Besides being a long nose used for smelling, breathing and trumpeting, it is also used as a hand to grab things – it is sensitive enough to pick up a blade of grass, and strong enough to rip the branches off a tree. The trunk is also used as a huge straw – elephants can suck up to 14 litres of water a time into their trunks and then blow this water into their mouths to drink. When bathing, they also use their trunk to spray themselves with water and mud. A great pub quiz question is how many muscles in an elephant’s trunk? Amazingly the answer is 40,000!</p>
                   <p>Elephant feet are covered in a soft padding that helps to support their weight, as well as preventing them from slipping and dulling the sound of their footsteps. As a result, elephants can walk almost silently, despite their huge weight. Furthermore, elephants use their feet to listen to the sub-sonic rumblings made by other elephants through vibrations in the ground. They have been observed to listen by putting their trunks on the ground and carefully positioning their feet.</p>
                   <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
                   <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
