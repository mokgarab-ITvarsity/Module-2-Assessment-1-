                   <h3>PANDA</h3>
                   <p>A panda year is equivalent to about three human years in terms of life expectancy. Giant pandas live 18–20 years in the wild and 25 to 30 years in captivity. The world's oldest giant panda was Xinxing (‘New Star') in Chongqing Zoo at 38 years old and four months (1982–2020). That's the equivalent of 115 human years. Wild pandas usually have just one cub, while pandas in captivity are more likely to have twins. In the wild, If the mother panda has two cubs, she will only feed the one she thinks is stronger. The other one is left to fend for itself. </p>
                   <p>The reason for this is that a newborn cub is very weak. Cubs start eating bamboo at around 12 months of age, but until then they are completely dependent on their mother. So, in the wild, female pandas don't have sufficient milk or energy to care for two cubs. A cub stays with its mother until she is pregnant again, when the cub is about a year and a half old. If the mother does not become pregnant, the cub will stay with its mother until it is two and a half years old.</p>
                   <p>Giant pandas are good tree climbers. They can climb trees from 7 months old. In the wild, giant pandas (particularly cubs) climb trees to avoid their enemies and survey their surroundings. As it is safer in a tree, many giant pandas like to sleep in trees. Sometimes, they just climb to look at the scenery. Giant pandas are bears, and like other bears, they can swim.</p>
                   <p>A typical 45-kilo (100-pound) adult spends as long as 12 hours eating 12 to 38 kilos (26–84 lb) of bamboo a day. Pandas can reach 150 kg (330 lb) in captivity and eat even more! When not eating and looking for food, pandas sleep most of the rest of the time. In the wild, giant pandas sleep for two to four hours between feeds. Giant pandas are solitary animals. In the wild, they have their own territory, and they do not allow it to be invaded by other pandas. That's because giant pandas feed on bamboo and do not need to hunt cooperatively. They need to eat a lot of bamboo to meet their nutritional needs.  If giant pandas lived in groups, there would be conflict over getting enough bamboo, which would negatively affect the survival of all. </p>
